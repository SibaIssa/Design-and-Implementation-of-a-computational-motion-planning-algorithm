   abstract = {Multirobot systems (MRS) are, nowadays, an important research area within robotics and artificial intelligence and a growing number of systems have recently been presented in the literature. Since application domains and tasks that are faced by MRS are of increasing complexity, the ability of the robots to cooperate can be regarded as a fundamental feature. In this paper, we present a survey of the recent work in the area by specifically examining the forms of cooperation and coordination realized in the MRS. In particular, we propose a new taxonomy for classification of the approaches to coordination in MRS and we describe some systems, which we consider representative in our taxonomy. We finally discuss the outcomes of our analysis and try to highlight future trends of the research on MRS.},

   abstract = {This article presents a simple adaptation mechanism to automatically adjust the ratio of foragers to resters (division of labor) in a swarm of foraging robots and hence maximize the net energy income to the swarm. Three adaptation rules are introduced based on local sensing and communications. Individual robots use internal cues (successful food retrieval), environmental cues (collisions with team-mates while searching for food) and social cues (team-mate success in food retrieval) to dynamically vary the time spent foraging or resting. Simulation results show that the swarm demonstrates successful adaptive emergent division of labor and robustness to environmental change (in food source density), and we observe that robots need to cooperate more when food is scarce. Furthermore, the adaptation mechanism is able to guide the swarm towards energy optimization despite the limited sensing and communication abilities of the individual robots and the simple social interaction rules. The swarm also exhibits the capacity to collectively perceive environmental changes; a capacity that can only be observed at a group level and cannot be deduced from individual robots.},

In this approach, collision avoidance, traditionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, allowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm using a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator control problem as direct control of manipulator motion in operational space-the space in which the task is originally described-rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kinematic transformation. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Using visual sensing, real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a method for planning the three-dimensional path for low-flying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in complex terrain based on interfered fluid dynamical system (IFDS) and the theory of obstacle avoidance by the flowing stream. With no requirement of solutions to fluid equations under complex boundary conditions, the proposed method is suitable for situations with complex terrain and different shapes of obstacles. Firstly, by transforming the mountains, radar and anti-aircraft fire in complex terrain into cylindrical, conical, spherical, parallelepiped obstacles and their combinations, the 3D low-flying path planning problem is turned into solving streamlines for obstacle avoidance by fluid flow. Secondly, on the basis of a unified mathematical expression of typical obstacle shapes including sphere, cylinder, cone and parallelepiped, the modulation matrix for interfered fluid dynamical system is constructed and 3D streamlines around a single obstacle are obtained. Solutions to streamlines with multiple obstacles are then derived using weighted average of the velocity field. Thirdly, extra control force method and virtual obstacle method are proposed to deal with the stagnation point and the case of obstacles’ overlapping respectively. Finally, taking path length and flight height as sub-goals, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to obtain optimal 3D path under the maneuverability constraints of the UAV. Simulation results show that the environmental modeling is simple and the path is smooth and suitable for UAV. Theoretical proof is also presented to show that the proposed method has no effect on the characteristics of fluid avoiding obstacles.},

The proposed method exploits the dynamical property of fluid flowing through a porous medium. This method evaluates risk to generate porosity values throughout the computational domain. The trajectory that encounters the highest porosity values determines the trajectory from the point of origin to the goal position. The best trajectory is found using the reaction of the fluid in porous media by the way of streamlines obtained by numerically solving the PDEs representing the fluid flow. Constraints due to UAV dynamics, obstacles, and predefined way points are applied to the problem after solving for the best trajectory to find the optimal and feasible trajectory. This method shows near-optimality and much reduced computational effort when compared to the other typical numerical optimization methods.},

   abstract = {In robotic navigation, path planning is aimed at getting the optimum collision-free path between a starting and target locations. The optimality criterion depends on the surrounding environment and the running conditions. In this paper, we propose a general, robust, and fast path planning framework for robotic navigation using level set methods. A level set speed function is proposed such that the minimum cost path between the starting and target locations in the environment, is the optimum planned path. The speed function is controlled by one parameter, which takes one of three possible values to generate either the safest, the shortest, or the hybrid planned path. The hybrid path is much safer than the shortest path, but less shorter than the safest one. The main idea of the proposed technique is to propagate a monotonic wave front with a particular speed function from a starting location until the target is reached and then extracts the optimum planned path between them by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) using an efficient numerical scheme. The framework supports both local and global planning for both 2D and 3D environments. The robustness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by correctly extracting planned paths of complex maps.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a noble multi-robot path planning algorithm using Deep q learning combined with CNN (Convolution Neural Network) algorithm. In conventional path planning algorithms, robots need to search a comparatively wide area for navigation and move in a predesigned formation under a given environment. Each robot in the multi-robot system is inherently required to navigate independently with collaborating with other robots for efficient performance. In addition, the robot collaboration scheme is highly depends on the conditions of each robot, such as its position and velocity. However, the conventional method does not actively cope with variable situations since each robot has difficulty to recognize the moving robot around it as an obstacle or a cooperative robot. To compensate for these shortcomings, we apply Deep q learning to strengthen the learning algorithm combined with CNN algorithm, which is needed to analyze the situation efficiently. CNN analyzes the exact situation using image information on its environment and the robot navigates based on the situation analyzed through Deep q learning. The simulation results using the proposed algorithm shows the flexible and efficient movement of the robots comparing with conventional methods under various environments.},

ABSTRACT = {In mobile robotics research, the exploration of unknown environments has always been an important topic due to its practical uses in consumer and military applications. One specific interest of recent investigation is the field of complete coverage and path planning (CCPP) techniques for mobile robot navigation. In this paper, we present a collaborative CCPP algorithms for single robot and multi-robot systems. The incremental coverage from the robot movement is maximized by evaluating a new cost function. A goal selection function is then designed to facilitate the collaborative exploration for a multi-robot system. By considering the local gains from the individual robots as well as the global gain by the goal selection, the proposed method is able to optimize the overall coverage efficiency. In the experiments, our CCPP algorithms are carried out on various unknown and complex environment maps. The simulation results and performance evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed collaborative CCPP technique.},

abstract = {Algorithms are at the heart of every nontrivial computer application, and algorithmics is a modern and active area of computer science. Every computer scientist and every professional programmer should know about the basic algorithmic toolbox: structures that allow efficient organization and retrieval of data, frequently used algorithms, and basic techniques for modeling, understanding and solving algorithmic problems. This book is a concise introduction addressed to students and professionals familiar with programming and basic mathematical language. Individual chapters cover arrays and linked lists, hash tables and associative arrays, sorting and selection, priority queues, sorted sequences, graph representation, graph traversal, shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and optimization. The algorithms are presented in a modern way, with explicitly formulated invariants, and comment on recent trends such as algorithm engineering, memory hierarchies, algorithm libraries and certifying algorithms. The authors use pictures, words and high-level pseudocode to explain the algorithms, and then they present more detail on efficient implementations using real programming languages like C++ and Java. The authors have extensive experience teaching these subjects to undergraduates and graduates, and they offer a clear presentation, with examples, pictures, informal explanations, exercises, and some linkage to the real world. Most chapters have the same basic structure: a motivation for the problem, comments on the most important applications, and then simple solutions presented as informally as possible and as formally as necessary. For the more advanced issues, this approach leads to a more mathematical treatment, including some theorems and proofs. Finally, each chapter concludes with a section on further findings, providing views on the state of research, generalizations and advanced solutions.},

abstract = {We study optimal multirobot path planning on graphs (MPP) over four minimization objectives: the makespan (last arrival time), the maximum (single-robot traveled) distance, the total arrival time, and the total distance. Having established previously that these objectives are distinct and NP-hard to optimize, in this paper, we focus on efficient algorithmic solutions for solving these optimal {MPP} problems. Toward this goal, we first establish a one-to-one solution mapping between {MPP} and a special type of multiflow network. Based on this equivalence and integer linear programming (ILP), we design novel and complete algorithms for optimizing over each of the four objectives. In particular, our exact algorithm for computing optimal makespan solutions is a first that is capable of solving extremely challenging problems with robot-vertex ratios as high as 100%. Then, we further improve the computational performance of these exact algorithms through the introduction of principled heuristics, at the expense of slight optimality loss. The combination of ILP model based algorithms and the heuristics proves to be highly effective, allowing the computation of 1.x-optimal solutions for problems containing hundreds of robots, densely populated in the environment, often in just seconds.},
