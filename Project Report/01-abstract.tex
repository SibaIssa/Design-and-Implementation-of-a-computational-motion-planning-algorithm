Formation of non-holonomic swarm robots has received a lot of considerations in both academia and industry over last two decades. Many path planning methods produce collision-free paths for a group of multiple robots, but many of them are computationally expensive and complex to implement and develop. In addition, these methods do not find a solution in all environments, or they find a solution that is not optimal. In this project, we present a computational motion planning algorithm based on fluid dynamics PDE for Robotic Swarms.
This proposed method features a computationally cheap algorithm, and it is easy to develop using updated tools and hardware. But, most importantly, it always ensures finding a path, because partial differential equations of fluid dynamics always finds a solution that describes the movement of the fluidâ€™s particles towards a goal. The aforementioned feature gives this algorithm a clear advantage because it is reliable, and it produces a smooth path.
The validity of this algorithm will be tested on a robotic swarm platform that we designed and implemented to ensure high quality and ease of use. The control of the swarm is preformed centrally, and a visual feedback is provided continually to the central computer from a camera that is fixed above the robots.
