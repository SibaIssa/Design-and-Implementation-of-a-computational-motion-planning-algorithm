   abstract = {We present new techniques for establishing lower bounds in robot motion planning problems. Our scheme is based on path encoding and uses homotopy equivalence classes of paths to encode state. We first apply the method to the shortest path problem in 3 dimensions. The problem is to find the shortest path under an Lp metric (e.g. a euclidean metric) between two points amid polyhedral obstacles. Although this problem has been extensively studied, there were no previously known lower bounds. We show that there may be exponentially many shortest path classes in single-source multiple-destination problems, and that the single-source single-destination problem is NP-hard. We use a similar proof technique to show that two dimensional dynamic motion planning with bounded velocity is NP-hard. Finally we extend the technique to compliant motion planning with uncertainty in control. Specifically, we consider a point in 3 dimensions which is commanded to move in a straight line, but whose actual motion may differ from the commanded motion, possibly involving sliding against obstacles. Given that the point initially lies in some start region, the problem of finding a sequence of commanded velocities which is guaranteed to move the point to the goal is shown to be non-deterministic exponential time hard, making it the first provably intractable problem in robotics.},

Since application domains and tasks that are faced by MRS are of increasing complexity, the ability of the robots to cooperate can be regarded as a fundamental feature. In this paper, we present a survey of the recent work in the area by specifically examining the forms of cooperation and coordination realized in the MRS. In particular, we propose a new taxonomy for classification of the approaches to coordination in MRS and we describe some systems, which we consider representative in our taxonomy. We finally discuss the outcomes of our analysis and try to highlight future trends of the research on MRS.},

The authors previously (1989) developed a PFM called the virtual force field (VFF) method. Much insight has been gained into the strengths and weaknesses of this method. Four distinct drawbacks with PFMs are identified. Because of these drawbacks, the authors abandoned potential field methods and developed a new method for fast obstacle avoidance. This method, called the vector field histogram method, produces smooth, nonoscillatory motion, while sampling time and hardware are identical to those used in the VFF method.<>},

   abstract = {This article presents a simple adaptation mechanism to automatically adjust the ratio of foragers to resters (division of labor) in a swarm of foraging robots and hence maximize the net energy income to the swarm. Three adaptation rules are introduced based on local sensing and communications. Individual robots use internal cues (successful food retrieval), environmental cues (collisions with team-mates while searching for food) and social cues (team-mate success in food retrieval) to dynamically vary the time spent foraging or resting. Simulation results show that the swarm demonstrates successful adaptive emergent division of labor and robustness to environmental change (in food source density), and we observe that robots need to cooperate more when food is scarce. Furthermore, the adaptation mechanism is able to guide the swarm towards energy optimization despite the limited sensing and communication abilities of the individual robots and the simple social interaction rules. The swarm also exhibits the capacity to collectively perceive environmental changes; a capacity that can only be observed at a group level and cannot be deduced from individual robots.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a physics-inspired method for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning in three dimensions using partial differential equations (PDEs) for application in dynamic hostile environments. The proposed method exploits the dynamical property of fluid flowing through a porous medium. This method evaluates risk to generate porosity values throughout the computational domain. The trajectory that encounters the highest porosity values determines the trajectory from the point of origin to the goal position. The best trajectory is found using the reaction of the fluid in porous media by the way of streamlines obtained by numerically solving the PDEs representing the fluid flow. Constraints due to UAV dynamics, obstacles, and predefined way points are applied to the problem after solving for the best trajectory to find the optimal and feasible trajectory. This method shows near-optimality and much reduced computational effort when compared to the other typical numerical optimization methods.},

   abstract = {In robotic navigation, path planning is aimed at getting the optimum collision-free path between a starting and target locations. The optimality criterion depends on the surrounding environment and the running conditions. In this paper, we propose a general, robust, and fast path planning framework for robotic navigation using level set methods. A level set speed function is proposed such that the minimum cost path between the starting and target locations in the environment, is the optimum planned path. The speed function is controlled by one parameter, which takes one of three possible values to generate either the safest, the shortest, or the hybrid planned path. The hybrid path is much safer than the shortest path, but less shorter than the safest one. The main idea of the proposed technique is to propagate a monotonic wave front with a particular speed function from a starting location until the target is reached and then extracts the optimum planned path between them by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) using an efficient numerical scheme. The framework supports both local and global planning for both 2D and 3D environments. The robustness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by correctly extracting planned paths of complex maps.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a method for planning the three-dimensional path for low-flying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in complex terrain based on interfered fluid dynamical system (IFDS) and the theory of obstacle avoidance by the flowing stream. With no requirement of solutions to fluid equations under complex boundary conditions, the proposed method is suitable for situations with complex terrain and different shapes of obstacles. Firstly, by transforming the mountains, radar and anti-aircraft fire in complex terrain into cylindrical, conical, spherical, parallelepiped obstacles and their combinations, the 3D low-flying path planning problem is turned into solving streamlines for obstacle avoidance by fluid flow. Secondly, on the basis of a unified mathematical expression of typical obstacle shapes including sphere, cylinder, cone and parallelepiped, the modulation matrix for interfered fluid dynamical system is constructed and 3D streamlines around a single obstacle are obtained. Solutions to streamlines with multiple obstacles are then derived using weighted average of the velocity field. Thirdly, extra control force method and virtual obstacle method are proposed to deal with the stagnation point and the case of obstacles’ overlapping respectively. Finally, taking path length and flight height as sub-goals, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to obtain optimal 3D path under the maneuverability constraints of the UAV. Simulation results show that the environmental modeling is simple and the path is smooth and suitable for UAV. Theoretical proof is also presented to show that the proposed method has no effect on the characteristics of fluid avoiding obstacles.},
