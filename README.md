### Project overview
1. Platform (4.2×4.2 [m²]) with high walls and different types of obstacles.
2. 15 octagon-shaped mobile robots  designed from scratch with dimensions (6×7×6 [m³]).
3. Implementing a computational motion planning algorithm on a single robot, then developing it and expanding it for the swarm of robots.
4. Comparing between our suggested algorithm and the famous algorithms in the literature (A*, Dijkstra, Potential Field) 
5. Extracting results that confirm the validity of the proposed algorithm and its superiority over conventional and non-traditional algorithms in terms of path-finding inevitability and other factors. You can check the following video: https://www.dropbox.com/s/yim75ajkh6q3i72/video.mp4?dl=0



### Abstract
Formation of non-holonomic swarm robots has received a lot of considerations in both academia and
industry over last two decades. Many path planning methods produce collision-free paths for a group of
multiple robots, but many of them are computationally expensive and complex to implement and develop.
In addition, these methods do not find a solution in all environments, or they find a solution that is not
optimal. In this project, we present a computational motion planning algorithm based on fluid dynamics
PDE for Robotic Swarms. This proposed method features a computationally cheap algorithm, and it is
easy to develop using updated tools and hardware. But, most importantly, it always ensures finding a
path, because partial differential equations of fluid dynamics always finds a solution that describes the
movement of the fluid’s particles towards a goal. The aforementioned feature gives this algorithm a clear
advantage because it is reliable, and it produces a smooth path. The validity of this algorithm will be
tested on a robotic swarm platform that we designed and implemented to ensure high quality and ease of
use. The control of the swarm is preformed centrally, and a visual feedback is provided continually to the
central computer from a camera that is fixed above the robots.
